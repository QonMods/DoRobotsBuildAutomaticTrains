Version: 1.2.3
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that trains went into automatic mode before checking ghosts at the back of the train.
    - Fixed that trains without locomotives would be set to automatic mode.
    - Thanks Techlone for [reporting these bugs!](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DoRobotsBuildAutomaticTrains/discussion/60b00d504c3f8600d360627e)

Version: 1.2.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed so trains don't go into auto mode when part if it is decontructed, which also cancelled
      deconstruction of rest of the train.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed so it works with editor mode instant blueprinting also. It will now start any train
      built in automatic mode. Might be annoying when you want to build a single locomotive to drive
      manually since you would have to switch the mode to manual. But there's a mod for
      automatically switching trains to manual mode when you try to drive them...
